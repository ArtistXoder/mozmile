# MinecraftServer
This is a Minecraft Sever setup for my Raspberry Pi 400 
This is my sever setup feel free to reuse for open source projects!
1) How to download type sudo apt-get install git 
2) Than type cd MinecraftServer
3) Next cd MinecraftScripts

5) Also you have to reboot the pi by typing sudo reboot.

#Last if you need to find the folder to checkout the file system type ls in the terminal. I will be using ssh and using raspbian lite with no desktop but you can use with any verison
#to Formate the sd card use the Raspberry PI image tool you can find it here at the offical website https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/
